## turntabl ethos

## Delivery
At Turntabl we expect and provide excellent delivery. Our plan for success centres on our clientele recognising us as a group that provides excellence, quality and delivery.

As someone who exhibits these qualities, a Turntabl employee is focussed on delivering a quality outcome. This includes anticipating challenges and finding solutions.

In order to keep delivering excellence Turntabl must be a group of great individuals. We will strive to deliver the right solution to our clients with the appropriate balance of time to market and quality for the problem.

Our focus on the right solution for the client, delivered with excellence is designed to create a positive environment where clients seek to work with us again and again and equally a company where we all enjoy working with each other.

## Benefit beyond profit
At the heart of Turntabl is the intention to give opportunity where it would otherwise be lacking. The goal is to benefit those who have capability and ambition but not the chance to use it.
Recognising the impact of previous lack of opportunity, our focus is on potential rather than on individuals’ current situations. 

Consequently we look holistically at how we can provide opportunity, including employment, physical space for training, or our own time to help educate and inspire others. 
Our commitment is long term, since we recognise that one-off events are not enough to bridge the opportunity gap.

## Integrity
As an organisation and as individuals we will act with integrity at all times treating everyone with respect. We will not accept bribery or other forms of corruption.

We expect everyone to conduct business honestly. This includes owning up to mistakes as well as successes, sticking by our endeavours during bad times and good.

Excellence will be critical to all we do, it can only come from our employees. Consequently employees will be expected to work hard. We believe that excellence comes from dedication and perseverance. 

Turntabl will provide flexibility around people’s lives. Employees should expect Turntabl to support them through life events. Neither employee nor employer will exploit these positive expectations.
 
## Continual improvement
To create a culture of excellence we must constantly strive to improve. Excellence will be achieved by making ourselves, our processes and systems better all the time.

While we will celebrate our successes we will also learn from our mistakes. Acknowledging and learning from mistakes and unforeseen events will help us to create a strong organisation. 

Learning is great fun – Turntabl employees can have fun learning and improving things, and contribute to this culture by also supporting others’ learning.
