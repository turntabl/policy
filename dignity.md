# turntabl Dignity at Work and Sexual Harassment Policy

Any form of sexual harassment is explicitly against the ethos and culture of turntabl. We have prepared this policy document in line with UK Government law and trade body representation. We take a zero tolerance approach to any form of sexual harassment and have detailed below the preventive measures and steps we will take in the case of any complaints.

## Why does turntabl have a sexual harassment policy?

turntabl is committed to providing an inclusive and supportive working environment for everyone who works here. This includes a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment and recognises appropriate steps should be taken to achieve this.

The aim of the policy is to set out expectations of behaviour by our staff, protect all staff from sexual harassment and foster a working environment that supports the dignity and respect of all employees and is free from any form of bullying or
harassment.

## Our commitment

turntabl will take seriously and investigate any complaints of discrimination, harassment or victimisation, using the agreed procedures and respecting confidentiality.

This policy is part of turntabl’s commitment to equality and diversity. We are committed to creating a workplace that respects and values each other’s differences, that promotes dignity and combats prejudice, discrimination and harassment.

This policy seeks to benefit the welfare of individual members of staff; retain valued employees; improve morale and performance and enhance the reputation of turntabl as an employer of choice.

All employees will be made aware of turntabl’s policy forbidding the sexual harassment of any employee by another employee and will be expected to comply with this policy. Sexual harassment will be treated as a disciplinary offence. Appropriate disciplinary action, including warnings, compulsory transfers (without protection of wages or salary), and dismissal for seriousoffences, may be taken against any employee who violates this policy. Abuse of power over another employee will be taken into account when deciding what disciplinary action to take. 

turntabl also recognises that it has a responsibility to protect employees from sexual harassment at work by clients, members of the public and contractors. All staff have the right to be treated with respect by the public they provide services to or work with. The sexual harassment of staff by clients, members of the public or contractors will not be tolerated and employees are encouraged to report it to their line manager.

All employees have a clear role to play in helping to create a work environment
in which all forms of bullying or harassing behaviour is unacceptable. In
particular, employees should be aware of their own conduct, avoid colluding with
inappropriate behaviour and co-operate fully in any complaints procedure. 

## Who does this policy apply to?

This policy applies to all staff who are employed by turntabl on and off the premises, including those working away from their main office or normal place of work, those on temporary contracts, and those working for companies bound by a Memorandum of Understanding with turntabl.

This policy will be communicated to all staff using a variety of methods including training, information and publicity, team briefings, departmental meetings and in-house publications.

## What is sexual harassment

Sexual harassment is unlawful. As defined by the Equality Act 2010, it is when a person engages in unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature, whether verbal, nonverbal or physical, that creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive, degrading or
humiliating working environment.

It is also unlawful to treat someone less favourably because they have either submitted a complaint of sexual harassment or have rejected such behaviour.

What is important is not necessarily the action, but how the recipient feels about what has been done and whether or not it is unwanted.

An individual can experience sexual harassment from someone of the same or different sex. It may be persistent or an isolated incident. Sexual harassment may be obvious or it may be subtle and more difficult to recognise. It can take place at any level and within any workplace relationship and can also be carried out by third parties such as clients, visitors or contractors.

It can happen anywhere in the workplace such as the canteen, toilets, staff room or office. It can also occur away from the workplace such as at a client’s home or office, at conferences, training courses, staff parties and other social events related to work. It may be face to face or in written communications, on the phone, while using social media and any other form of online interaction including email communication in or outside of a work situation.

It may take place in private or in public. Whatever form it takes, it is unwarranted and unwelcome to the individual.

The list below shows some examples of common forms of sexual harassment but is by no means exhaustive.

Examples of sexual harassment include:
* unwelcome sexual advances, propositions and demands for sexual favours
* unwanted or derogatory comments or nicknames about clothing or appearance
* leering and suggestive gestures and remarks or jokes
* intrusive questioning or suggestions about your sex life or a colleague’s sex life, and discussing their own sex life
* sexual posts or contact on social media
* spreading sexual rumours about a person
* sending sexually explicit emails or text messages
* comments of a sexual nature about your or a colleague’s sexual orientation
* comments of a sexual nature about your or a colleague’s gender identity
* displaying offensive material, such as pornographic pictures or calendars, including those in electronic forms such as computer screen savers or by circulating such material in emails or via social media
* ‘upskirting’ that typically involves someone taking a picture under another person’s clothing without their knowledge
* predatory behaviour
* coercion
* physical contact such as the invasion of personal space and unnecessary touching, hugging or kissing through to sexual assault, indecent exposure, stalking and rape (although rape is defined as a separate criminal offence).

## What steps will turntabl take to help prevent sexual harassment? 

turntabl recognises that there are many organisational measures that can help prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. These include:
* good management practice, including competent, respectful people management, recognition of sexual harassment and appropriate intervention 
* undertaking risk assessments that include consideration of power imbalances, job insecurity, lone working, client-facing duties, lack of diversity in the workforce
* appropriate induction and training on sexual harassment and about this policy for all staff, including supervisors, managers and new staff. This will include information on what constitutes harassment and, for managers and supervisors, on what their responsibilities are. A copy of the policy will be made available to all staff on the intranet, and a copy will be provided to all new employees on induction.
* specific training for Contact Officers and all managers and supervisors potentially responsible for investigating complaints
* awareness-raising about the issues of sexual harassment and the requirement of respectful behaviour
* ensuring employees have somewhere to go for a confidential discussion of their situation and signposting ways of taking further action
* improving the gender balance at all levels of the organisation
* improving diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organisation

## What responsibilities do managers and supervisors have? 

Managers and supervisors should ensure that all employees are aware of this policy and understand their own and turntabl's responsibilities. Training on sexual harassment will be provided to all managers.

Managers and supervisors have a particular responsibility to ensure that within their area of control, everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. They should:
* always challenge any unacceptable behaviour in the workplace
* respond to complaints of sexual harassment swiftly, sensitively and objectively and be aware of behaviour that would cause offence, if necessary reminding employees of expected standards
* deal explicitly with third party perpetrators (such as clients, visitors or contractors) with a view to withdrawing service or ending a contract or banning from the premises if behaviour is not moderated
* ensure that this policy is followed and that there are thorough investigations if required. A Contact Officer will assist any line manager in dealing with complaints of sexual harassment.

All complaints of sexual harassment must be dealt with confidentially using the agreed procedures.

Managers and supervisors have an additional responsibility to be exemplars of acceptable behaviour. They should be aware that an abuse of their positional power will send mixed messages about what is acceptable behaviour, and will only serve to condone harassment.

A line manager’s failure to actively implement this policy within their area of responsibility or to fail to deal with sexual harassment when they become aware of it could constitute a breach of the policy and disciplinary action may be taken.

## Who are turntabl's contact officers?

turntabl recognises that there can be difficulties in raising the issue of sexual harassment and bullying, particularly if:
* the immediate manager is doing the harassing
* the employee is reluctant or too embarrassed to raise the matter with their manager, or feels the manager may lack the skills, knowledge or sensitivity to deal with complaints of harassment
* the employee finds the prospect of using the formal procedure intimidating.

turntabl is committed to ensuring that such potential difficulties are overcome so that allegations of sexual harassment are raised and can be acted upon.

To help ensure this specially trained officer(s) – the Contact Officer(s) – have been designated to deal with complaints of sexual harassment and to offer advice to employees who believe that they or their colleagues have experienced sexual harassment.

The main role of the Contact Officer(s) is to:
* provide sympathetic assistance to employees with complaints of sexual harassment
* explain to them how the procedures for making a complaint operate
* establish the main details of any complaint
* channel the complaint to the appropriate manager for action if the employee decides to take the matter further.

turntabl will ensure that Contact Officers receive special training in carrying out their role.

Contact Officers will discuss cases in complete confidence and will not divulge information to any other person without the agreement of the employee.

A employee who comes to Contact Officer(s) to talk about sexual harassment is under no obligation to take further action. The Contact Officer(s) are there to help employees decide what they want to do. Employees who have been sexually harassed are not obliged to refer their complaints to Contact Officer(s). It is entirely up to them whether they do so. However, the nomination of Contact Officer(s) is an additional means of ensuring that such employees are not discouraged from bringing forward complaints.

## What are my responsibilities as a turntabl employee?

All staff have a responsibility to contribute to a respectful and productive working environment. They have a duty to assist in the creation of a safe working environment, where unacceptable sexual behaviour is not tolerated.

Every employee has a personal responsibility to:
* ensure they understand the nature of sexual harassment
* be aware of how their behaviour may affect others and to uphold the standards of behaviour set within the  work within the policy guidelines including co-operating fully in any investigation undertaken
* be aware of sexual harassment and challenge unacceptable behaviour where appropriate if it is safe to intervene.
Possible ways of intervening include telling the harasser that their behaviour is unacceptable; distracting either the harasser or the target to defuse the situation and also checking in with the target of the behaviour after it has taken place. It is validating for them to know that another person believes what has happened is not acceptable
* reporting incidents of sexual harassment when witnessed, or supporting targets of sexual harassment in reporting it, and co-operating in an investigation into alleged sexual harassment.

Employees should report any instances of harassment, victimisation or discrimination experienced whether they are the target of the behaviour or they have witnessed it. Reporting is necessary in order to address the issue both for the employee's own well-being and that of their colleagues. However turntabl recognises that there may be many reasons that someone who has experienced sexual harassment may not complain immediately.

If an employee is found to have sexually harassed, victimised or discriminated against another employee, then they will be seen as having committed a disciplinary offence.

## What happens if I have been the target of sexual harassment, or if I have seen sexual harassment occur?

You do not have to be the recipient or target to make a complaint about sexual harassment. If you see it happening or become aware of the problem you have the right to complain about it.

Tackling sexual harassment is everybody’s responsibility.

Some people are unaware that their behaviour in some circumstances is sexual harassment. If it is clearly pointed out to them that their behaviour is unacceptable, the problem can sometimes be resolved. With this in mind, this policy includes informal as well as formal action to deal with complaints of sexual
harassment.

### Informal Action

1. If possible, an employee who believes that they have been the subject of sexual harassment or has witnessed it should, in the first instance, ask the person to stop the behaviour and make it clear what aspect of their behaviour is offensive and unacceptable, and the effect it is having. This can be done either verbally or in writing. If the sexually harassed person or witness feels unable to approach the person responsible directly, a Contact Officer or work colleague can make this initial approach.
1. If an employee is approached informally about stopping their unwelcome or upsetting behaviour, they should not consider the reaction to be oversensitive nor the incident to be too trivial but should remember that different people find different things acceptable and everyone has the right to decide what behaviour is acceptable to them and to have their feelings respected by others. An apology and assurance that the behaviour will not be repeated may be enough to end the matter.
1. If an employee who believes that he or she has been the subject of sexual harassment or has witnessed it is unable to adopt the above approach, or the sexual harassment is of a very serious nature, they can approach a Contact Officer who will provide informal advice in confidence. No further action will be taken without the consent of the employee making the complaint.

Confidential advice is also available to other employees who themselves may not be the subject of sexual harassment but are concerned about the sexual harassment of others.
1. If an employee complains of sexual harassment but does not want to take the matter any further, turntabl will keep a record of the complaint and periodically check in with the employee to find out if the situation has improved.

Turntabl will respect the wishes of the complainant but there may be some circumstances where the harassment is of such a serious nature that turnabl will need to take action because of the high immediate risk to the safety of the complainant, their colleagues or someone else the harasser may come into contact with. In such situations, turntabl will put in place appropriate safeguards to prevent further harassment, or victimisation of the complainant. 

### Formal action

If informal action does not stop the sexual harassment, or a formal complaint is made from the outset, the complaints procedure should be initiated and a formal report should be made. Throughout this procedure, the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made has the right to be accompanied by a colleague, and to seek informal advice from a Contact Officer. 

1. an employee who believes that they have been the subject of sexual harassment should formally report the alleged act or acts to their line manager, or if the person doing the harassment is the line manager, a more senior manager. Where possible, the employee should set out details of the complaint in writing with specifics as to dates and times and an account of what the sexual harassment is alleged to consist of.
1. All complaints will be handled and investigated in a timely and confidential manner. The complainant will be invited to a meeting to the manager within 3 days of reporting the alleged act or acts. The employee has the right to be accompanied by a work colleague at this meeting.
1. Confidentiality will be maintained at all times including by witnesses spoken to as part of the investigation, subject to any requirement to involve external agencies where a criminal offence may have been committed or where maintaining confidentially would pose a risk to the complainant, or to others. Employees shall be guaranteed a fair and impartial hearing whether they are the harassed or the harasser. Breach of confidentiality may be a disciplinary offence.
1. As a first stage in a thorough investigation of the complaint, a senior manager will arrange to interview separately both the complainant, and the person against whom the complaint has been made, with a representative if requested. Wherever possible the investigator will not be the same person who hears the complaint nor any subsequent appeal, in order to help ensure independence and objectivity. Because of any particular sensitivities of the case, it is recognised that the complainant may prefer to talk to an investigator of the same sex.
1. A target timescale for completion of the investigation will be set and communicated to the complainant, along with updates on progress. Should the target timescale not be met, a clear explanation should be given to the complainant by turntabl.
1. Wherever possible, turntabl will try to ensure that both the complainant, and the person against whom the complaint has been made are not required to work together while the complaint is under investigation.

In a serious case, the person against whom the complaint has been made may be suspended while investigation and any subsequent disciplinary procedure are undertaken as a precaution for the protection of the complainant or to prevent interference in the investigation. Such suspension will be for as short a time as possible and will be on full pay.
1. Following the investigation, the senior manager will give a detailed response in writing to the complainant including outcomes wherever appropriate or possible, including action taken to address the specific complaint if it is upheld, and any measures taken to prevent a similar event happening again in the future.
1. If the investigation reveals that the complaint is upheld, prompt action designed to stop the sexual harassment immediately and prevent its recurrence will be taken.
1. Disciplinary action up to and including dismissal may be taken in accordance with the staff disciplinary procedure if a complaint of sexual harassment is upheld. Appropriate adjustments will be made to enable the complainant to participate in the disciplinary process without fear
of victimisation.
1. If the sexual harassment is believed to be a criminal offence, such as a sexual assault, indecent exposure, stalking and offensive communications, the senior manager should advise the complainant to report the matter to the police as soon as possible and give them appropriate support. In cases where the police are involved, turntab will liaise with the police regarding the disciplinary process and take advice on how to conduct a fair process.
1. If it is believed that there is an ongoing risk of serious harm to an individual, the senior manager will contact the police themselves and inform the complainant that they have done so.
1. Workers shall be protected from intimidation, victimisation or discrimination for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation. Retaliating against a worker for complaining about or assisting in an investigation of sexual harassment is a disciplinary offence.
1. Any decisions taken under this procedure do not preclude any worker from pursuing a grievance in the usual way under the staff grievance procedures and/or reporting the matter to the police should they believe that a criminal offence may have been committed.
1. The complainant has the right to appeal against the decision following the
investigation within 30 days of receiving the decision from the senior manager. Any appeal must be made in writing, stating the reasons for the appeal.
1. An appeal meeting will be arranged with a more senior manager not previously involved in the procedure who will consider the appeal. The worker will be given the opportunity to put forward their case and explain why they are not satisfied with the outcome. The meeting may be adjourned by the person hearing the appeal, if it is considered necessary to undertake further investigation. The meeting will be reconvened as soon as possible.
1. The decision of the person hearing the appeal shall be final. 

## How is the policy reviewed and monitored?

Adequate resources will be made available to fulfil the aims of this policy. The policy will be widely promoted, and copies will be freely available on the company github account https://github.com/turntabl/policy.

This policy will be reviewed jointly by staff and management, on a regular basis. The initial review of effectiveness will take place six months after this policy comes into effect. Thereafter, reviews will be carried out at intervals of not more than 12 months.

turntabl will also periodically monitor how successful it is in creating a workplace free of sexual harassment by other means which may include confidential staff surveys, training, raising awareness of harassment and bullying in general and undertaking risk assessments. 

## What support is available for staff who have been sexually harassed?

turntabl recognises that sexual harassment can affect job performance and cause stress, anxiety or other mental health as well as physical health problems. Where sexual harassment causes deterioration in job performance, this will be treated as a health problem and the person will be encouraged to seek help under the terms of this policy. *There will be no discrimination against individuals suffering from stress caused by sexual harassment*.

Access to independent and trained counsellors will be available to all staff. This service will be strictly confidential between the counsellor and member of staff. No details or records will be disclosed without the written permission of the member of staff concerned.

Workers who have been sexually harassed will be offered paid time off to attend counselling sessions. 

Where the workers’ complaint is not upheld, or it is upheld but results in disciplinary action short of dismissal of the harasser, mediation and/or an offer of redeployment may be offered to affected parties.
